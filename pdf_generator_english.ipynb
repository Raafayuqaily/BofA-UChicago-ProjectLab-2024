      "\n",
      "### Overview\n",
      "Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a prominent technology company listed on NASDAQ. The data spans from 2006 to 2024, covering quarterly (Q) and annual (A) periods. Key metrics include long-term debt and diluted EPS (Earnings Per Share).\n",

      "### Key Observations\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Revenue and EPS Growth\n",
      "- **EPS Growth**: Over the years, Apple's EPS has shown significant growth. For instance, the EPS for Q1 2006 was $0.0168, while for Q4 2024, it reached $6.08 annually. This reflects Apple's strong revenue growth and profitability.\n",
      "- **Quarterly Fluctuations**: EPS tends to be higher in the December quarter, reflecting strong holiday sales. For example, EPS was $2.18 in Q4 2023, compared to $1.26 in Q3 2023.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Long-Term Debt\n",
      "- **Debt Levels**: Long-term debt levels have fluctuated. For instance, in Q4 2013, it was $16,896 million, and in Q4 2024, it was $99,580 million. The increase in debt over time is common for large corporations like Apple, often used for strategic investments and share buybacks.\n",
      "- **Recent Trends**: There was a notable increase in debt in recent years, peaking at over $100 billion. Monitoring debt levels is crucial to assess financial leverage and risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Sector and Exchange\n",
      "- **Technology Sector**: Apple is part of the technology sector, which is known for rapid innovation and growth. The sector code is consistently 10.\n",
      "- **NASDAQ Listing**: Apple has been listed on NASDAQ, a major exchange for technology companies.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Trends and Insights\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Consistent Growth**: Apple's consistent growth in EPS reflects its ability to innovate and capture market share in various product categories, including iPhones, iPads, Macs, and services.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Seasonality**: Apple's financials exhibit seasonality, with stronger performance in the December quarter due to holiday sales. This is a common trend for consumer electronics companies.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Debt Utilization**: The increase in long-term debt suggests strategic financial management, possibly for capital investments, acquisitions, or shareholder returns. It's essential to assess\n",
